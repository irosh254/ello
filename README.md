This is an SPA that is conceptualized as a childrens books search using the React Framework with MaterialUI.

The App has the following features:-

1. A search bar that allows users to search for books by title.
2. A list of search results that displays the book title, author, and a button to add the book to the students reading list.
3. A reading list that displays all the books that the teacher has added.
4. A button to remove a book from the reading list.

For both the backend and frontend you will run these 2 commands:
npm install
npm start
